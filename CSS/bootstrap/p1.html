        <h3> Artical 1</h3>
        <p>Explaining why I'm downvoting. There's an obvious reason why this is being asked; because it's contrary to
            what programmers are used to. Constants in C/C++ are typically defined by an immutable macro, in PHP by a
            specific define() function. When programmers say "constant", they typically mean "something that will not
            change", nevermind the mathetmatics under the hood. That's why ONLY IN JAVASCRIPT people are consistently
            confused by this bizarre choice of keyword use; because it's a bad one. The answer here isn't technically
            incorrect per se, it's just also not very useful. </p>
